# Python - Test-driven development (0x07)

## Overview

This project, titled \"Python - Test-driven development,\" revolves around the concept of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python. Initiated on Jan 2, 2024, at 6:00 AM, it is slated to conclude by Jan 8, 2024, at 6:00 AM, with the Checker release at the same time. An auto review will follow the Checker release.

## Key Concepts

1. **Never forget a test:** Emphasizing the importance of writing tests first.
2. **Documentation and tests before coding:** Encouraging the practice of writing documentation and tests prior to implementing functionality.
3. **Importance of edge cases:** Stressing the consideration of all possible edge cases in testing.

## Important Dates

- **Project Start:** Jan 2, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Project End:** Jan 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Jan 8, 2024, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review Deadline:** Jan 8, 2024 (after Checker release)

## Guidelines

### Python Scripts

1. **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs.
2. **Interpreter:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).
3. **File Format:** All files should end with a new line.
4. **Shebang Line:** The first line of all files should be exactly \`#!/usr/bin/python3\`.
5. **README.md:** Include a README.md file at the root of the project folder.
6. **Code Style:** Adhere to pycodestyle (version 2.8.*).
7. **Execution:** All files must be executable.
8. **Length Check:** The length of files will be tested using wc.

### Python Test Cases

1. **File Format:** All files should end with a new line.
2. **Test Folder:** Place all test files inside a folder named \`tests\`.
3. **Extension:** Test files should have a \`.txt\` extension.
4. **Execution:** Execute tests using the command: \`python3 -m doctest ./tests/*\`.
5. **Documentation:** Modules and functions should have documentation.
6. **Documentation Check:** Documentation is not a single word; it should be a real sentence explaining the purpose (length will be verified).
7. **Collaboration:** Collaboration on test cases is encouraged.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the significance of Python programming.
- Grasp the concept of an interactive test.
